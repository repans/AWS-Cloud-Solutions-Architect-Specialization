# Capstone Project  

As part of this assignment, you will create a high-level architecture diagram that uses 
[AWS service icons and arrows](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/) 
to depict an AWS solution for the given scenario. Create your diagram by using a tool like  
[diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/?splash=0&libs=aws4)
, or you can select a different tool by from the 
[AWS Architecture Icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/) 
page by scrolling to the **Drawing and diagramming tools section**.

**Scenario:** Imagine that you work at a company that is planning to use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) as the storage layer for their data lakes solution. Initially, the data that will be ingested into the data lake will come from three locations:
- Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that send real-time data
- A database with historical records  
- Supplemental data from third-party entities for enriching internally generated data  

The company has tasked you with designing solutions for ingesting this data into their data lake, and each location (IoT sensors, database, and third party) will need its own ingestion solution. From there, you will need to also design a solution for how to clean or transform the data so that it can be analyzed. The company currently uses Apache Hadoop-based software. When possible, they prefer to use similar technologies in the cloud so that they donâ€™t need to retrain their analytics team on too many new technologies at one time. The company also has a requirement to create dashboards that show visual representations of the insights they derive from the data.

**External resources for research:**
- [Data Analytics Lens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/analytics-lens/analytics-lens.html) of the AWS Well-Architected Framework
- [Solutions for Analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/analytics/) in the AWS Solutions Library


**Instructions:** Create an architecture diagram that depicts the data-lakes-and-analytics solution you would design for this company. Think about why you designed the solution the way that you did, and how the solution works.
