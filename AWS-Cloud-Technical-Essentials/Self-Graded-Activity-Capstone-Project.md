# Self-Graded Activity Capstone Project


As part of this assignment, you will create a high-level architecture diagram that uses 
[AWS service icons and arrows](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/) 
to depict an AWS solution for the given scenario. Create your diagram by using a tool like
[diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/?splash=0&libs=aws4) 
, or you can select a different tool by from the 
[AWS Architecture Icon](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/) 
page by scrolling to the **Drawing and diagramming tools section**.

**Scenario:** You have a web application that accepts requests from the internet. Clients can send requests to query for data. When a request comes in, the web application queries a MySQL database and returns the data to the client.

**Instructions:** Design a three-tier architecture that follows AWS best practices by using services such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) with high availability, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). Create an architecture diagram that lays out your design, including the networking layer, compute layer, database layer, and anything else that’s needed to accurately depict the architecture. Write a few paragraphs that explain why you chose the AWS services that you used and how they would support the solution for the given scenario. Your explanation must describe how traffic flows through the different AWS components—from the client to the backend database, and back to the client.
